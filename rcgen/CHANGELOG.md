## Release 0.12.0 - December 16, 2023

- Rename `RcgenError` to `Error`. Contributed by [thomaseizinger](https://github.com/thomaseizinger).
- The public interface of `Error` has been made not expose external library types: `Error::PemError` now holds a `String` value, and the `Error` type doesn't support `From<_>` based conversion any more. This allows rcgen to update dependencies without impacting downstream users.
- Upgrade to `ring` `v0.17`. Contributed by [thomaseizinger](https://github.com/thomaseizinger).
- Make dependency on `ring` optional and allow usage of `aws-lc-rs` via a cargo feature. Ring remains the default. Contributed by [BiagioFesta](https://github.com/BiagioFesta).
- Add `Ia5String` support for `DistinguishedName`s.
- Add a `KeyIdMethod::PreSpecified` variant to set, and not generate the SKI. `CertificateParams::from_ca_cert_pem` now uses it when building params from an existing CA certificate. Contributed by [Brocar](https://github.com/Brocar).
